## Migration Overview

### Rationale for Migration

Rather than integrating with the legacy Java backend, we have decided to migrate to a new backend for the following reasons:

- **Technical Freedom**: A clean slate allows us to design without legacy constraints
- **Performance Optimization**: Build for speed and efficiency from the ground up
- **Feature Acceleration**: Implement new features more quickly
- **Reduced Technical Debt**: Avoid accumulating workarounds and patches
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Maintain one unified system instead of two integrated ones

### Migration Approach

The migration will follow these high-level steps:

1. **Analysis**: Map existing data structures and relationships
2. **Design**: Create the new backend architecture and database schema
3. **Development**: Build the new backend system
4. **Data Migration**: Extract, transform, and load data from the legacy system
5. **Testing**: Validate the new system with migrated data
6. **Deployment**: Roll out the new system across all branches
7. **Decommissioning**: Retire the legacy system after successful migration

## Technology Stack

### API Layer
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better maintainability

### Database
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust relational database with JSON capabilities
- **Prisma/TypeORM**: ORM for database access with type safety
- **Redis**: For caching and session management

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT**: For secure authentication
- **Passport.js**: Authentication middleware
- **bcrypt**: For password hashing
- **Role-based access control**: Custom implementation for specific roles
- **Admin-only user management**: Tools for administrators to create and manage user accounts

### API Documentation
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: For API documentation
- **Postman**: For API testing and collaboration

## Data Migration Strategy

### Data Sources

The migration will extract data from the following sources in the legacy system:

- **Patient Records**: Personal information, medical history, and visit records
- **User Accounts**: Staff accounts, roles, and permissions
- **Clinical Data**: Consultations, diagnoses, prescriptions, and lab results
- **Financial Records**: Billing information, payments, and insurance claims
- **Configuration Data**: System settings, document templates, and branch information

### Migration Process

1. **Data Extraction**:
   - Create scripts to extract data from the Java backend database
   - Export data in a structured format (JSON, CSV, or SQL dumps)
   - Preserve relationships between different data entities

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Clean and normalize the extracted data
   - Convert data formats where necessary
   - Resolve inconsistencies and duplicates
   - Map legacy data structures to the new schema

3. **Data Loading**:
   - Import transformed data into the new PostgreSQL database
   - Validate data integrity after import
   - Generate new IDs and references where needed
   - Preserve historical data with appropriate timestamps

4. **Verification**:
   - Compare record counts between old and new systems
   - Validate critical data points through sampling
   - Run business logic tests against migrated data
   - Perform user acceptance testing with real-world scenarios

## Backend Architecture

### Service-Oriented Architecture

The new backend will be organized into logical services:

- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and session management
- **User Service**: Manages user accounts, roles, and permissions
- **Patient Service**: Manages patient records and medical history
- **Clinical Service**: Handles consultations, diagnoses, and treatments
- **Pharmacy Service**: Manages medications and prescriptions
- **Laboratory Service**: Handles lab tests and results
- **Billing Service**: Manages invoices, payments, and insurance claims
- **Document Service**: Handles document generation and management
- **Settings Service**: Manages system configuration and preferences

### Multi-Branch Support

The architecture will support multiple hospital branches:

- **Branch Context**: All API requests include branch context
- **Data Partitioning**: Data is logically partitioned by branch
- **Cross-Branch Access**: Authorized users can access data across branches
- **Branch-Specific Settings**: Each branch can have its own configuration

## Authentication & Authorization

### User Management

- **Admin-Only Registration**: No self-registration; all accounts created by administrators
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions for different user roles
- **Branch Assignment**: Users are assigned to specific branches
- **Remote Access Control**: Administrators can grant remote access permissions

### Authentication Flow

1. User logs in with username, password, and branch selection
2. System validates credentials and branch access permissions
3. System generates JWT token with user information, role, and branch context
4. Token is used for subsequent API requests
5. Redis stores session information for quick validation

### Authorization System

- **Role Hierarchy**: Supa Admin > Admin > Department Heads > Staff
- **Permission Matrix**: Granular permissions for different operations
- **Branch-Based Access Control**: Data access restricted by branch assignment
- **"Login As" Functionality**: Admins can impersonate other users for support

## API Design

### RESTful API Structure

The API will follow RESTful principles with these conventions:

- **Base URL**: `/api/v1`
- **Resource-Based Routes**: `/api/v1/patients`, `/api/v1/appointments`, etc.
- **HTTP Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE for CRUD operations
- **Query Parameters**: For filtering, sorting, and pagination
- **Request Body**: JSON format for data submission
- **Response Format**: Consistent JSON structure with status and data

### API Versioning

- **URL-Based Versioning**: `/api/v1/...`, `/api/v2/...`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain support for older versions during transition

### Error Handling

- **HTTP Status Codes**: Appropriate codes for different error types
- **Error Response Format**: Consistent structure with code, message, and details
- **Validation Errors**: Detailed feedback for form validation failures
- **Logging**: Comprehensive error logging for troubleshooting

## Database Schema

### Core Entities

- **Users**: Staff accounts with roles and permissions
- **Branches**: Hospital locations with specific settings
- **Patients**: Patient personal and medical information
- **Visits**: Patient visits and consultations
- **Diagnoses**: Medical diagnoses and conditions
- **Prescriptions**: Medication prescriptions
- **Lab Tests**: Laboratory test orders and results
- **Admissions**: Inpatient admissions and bed assignments
- **Invoices**: Billing information and payment records
- **Insurance**: Insurance providers and policy information
- **Documents**: Generated documents and templates

### Schema Design Principles

- **Normalization**: Proper normalization to reduce redundancy
- **Indexing**: Strategic indexes for performance optimization
- **Constraints**: Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- **Timestamps**: Created/updated timestamps for all records
- **Soft Deletion**: Flagging records as deleted rather than removing them
- **Branch Context**: Branch ID as a dimension in relevant tables
